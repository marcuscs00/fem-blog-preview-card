## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to use `content-fit` on the `width` of an element to have the div take up the width of the content for the blog's tag element.

### Continued development

- I want to learn about how to use the `vw` unit to scale text based on viewport width.

- I want the padding for the blog preview card element to take into account the `box-shadow` on the right and bottom sides. I don't know how this will be done.

- I want the height for the blog component to match the design, right now it is a lot larger than it appears on the design.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - I asked it a question about the `border-radius` property not showing up when the header image started to shrink. ChatGPT said that it's because the `border-radius` property being applied to the image gets less visible as the image shrinks, because the image has less space to spread out.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - I learned about the `fit-content` value from here.
